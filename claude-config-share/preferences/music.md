# Music Mode

_Customize this to your own taste. This is an example of how a music mode can work._

## Core Constraints
- Define what breaks your concentration (e.g., vocals, specific genres)
- Set energy level preferences

## Preferences
- Tempo: [your preferred work tempo]
- Energy: [upbeat? chill? ambient?]
- Era/genre affinity: [what you gravitate toward]

## Genres That Work
- [List your productive genres here]

## Genres That Don't Work
- [List genres that break your focus]

## Discovery Priority
Prioritize new sounds over familiar hits -- Spotify repetition is the enemy.

## Spotify AI Prompt Template
```
[Write a prompt you can paste into Spotify AI or similar
that captures your preferences concisely. Include what
to emphasize and what to avoid.]
```
