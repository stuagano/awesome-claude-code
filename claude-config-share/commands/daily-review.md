## Daily Review

Pull together a morning briefing from your connected services.

### Step 1: Calendar

Fetch today's events from your calendars. Customize the calendar list below to match your setup.

**Calendars to check:**
- Primary (personal schedule)
- Work
- Family/shared calendars
- Task deadline calendar (if synced from task manager)

Present as a merged timeline with "next 2 hours" callout.

### Step 2: Tasks

Fetch today's tasks + any overdue items from your task manager (Todoist, etc.).
Group by project.

### Step 3: Business Snapshot (optional)

If you have a business tool connected (Shopify, Stripe, etc.), pull:
- Yesterday's key metrics
- Items needing attention (unfulfilled orders, open tickets, etc.)

### Step 4: Synthesis

Present the combined output as a clean briefing:
- **Calendar first** (time-sensitive) -- note meetings in the next 2 hours
- **Action items from tasks** -- overdue items flagged prominently
- **Business snapshot** -- if applicable

Keep it concise. No fluff.
