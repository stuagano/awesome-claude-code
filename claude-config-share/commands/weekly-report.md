Compile a weekly summary from your connected services.

1. **Business metrics** (if applicable):
   - This week's sales total and order count
   - Best-selling products this week
   - Compare to last week if possible

2. **Task productivity**:
   - Tasks completed this week
   - Group completions by project
   - Note any still-overdue tasks

3. **Format**: Present as a clean weekly report with:
   - Key metrics snapshot
   - Productivity snapshot
   - Week-over-week trends if available
   - Top 3 priorities for next week (suggest based on overdue/upcoming)
